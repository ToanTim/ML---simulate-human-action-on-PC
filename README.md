### Feature: Auto Gem Mining Implementation

**Screen Recognition and Interaction:**

- Use a library like OpenCV or PyAutoGUI to capture screenshots of the game screen.
- Analyze the screenshots to detect elements like the game map, gem mines, and gathering commanders.

**Map Exploration:**

- Simulate mouse movements and scrolling to navigate the map.
- Continuously scan the map for gem mines.

**Gem Mine Detection:**

- Implement image recognition algorithms to identify gem mines on the map.
- Once a gem mine is found, record its location.

**Commander Interaction:**

- Identify available gathering commanders on the map.
- Select appropriate commanders for gem mining.

**Gathering Process:**

- Send the selected commanders to the gem mine location.
- Monitor their status to determine if they are already mining or if they have finished.
- If finished, recall them back to the city.

**Repeat Process:**

- Continuously repeat the above steps to ensure efficient gem mining.

**Error Handling:**

- Implement error handling mechanisms to deal with unexpected situations such as game updates, network issues, or incorrect screen recognition.

**Optimization:**

- Optimize the script for performance and efficiency to minimize resource usage and maximize gem mining output.

**Testing and Refinement:**

- Test the script extensively to ensure reliability and effectiveness.
- Refine the script based on feedback and observations during testing.

**User Interface (Optional):**

- Optionally, create a simple user interface to start and stop the automation process, adjust settings, and view logs.
